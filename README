= MultiExiftool

== Description

This library is wrapper for the Exiftool command-line application
(http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool) written by Phil Harvey.
It is designed for dealing with multiple files at once by creating
commands to call exiftool with various arguments, call it and parsing
the results.

== Examples

=== Reading

  require 'multi_exiftool'

  reader = MultiExiftool::Reader.new
  reader.filenames = Dir['*.jpg']
  results = reader.read
  results.each do |values|
   puts "#{values.file_name}: #{values.comment}"
  end

=== Writing

  require 'multi_exiftool'

  writer = MultiExiftool::Writer.new
  writer.filenames = Dir['*.jpg']
  writer.values = {creator: 'Jan Friedrich', copyright: 'Public Domain'}
  if writer.write
    puts 'ok'
  else
    puts writer.errors.join
  end
